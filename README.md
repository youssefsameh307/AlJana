We should start by making a user module with a Auth, we can tackle it front end and backend in the same time, test it and then proceed to next module 

users are two categories users and Admins for now Admins can view All users so current stuff that we need to implement is :

1- Register
2- Login
3- CRUD without a delete for the user we are going to do soft Deletes, Put a an extra field in the user table named Deleted and queries get non deleted user
4- the ability for admins to view all users.
